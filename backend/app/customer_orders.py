"""
Customer-facing order creation and listing.

Security contract
-----------------
- customer_id is ALWAYS derived from the authenticated identity; it is never
  accepted from the request body or any browser-supplied value.
- Customers may only see their own orders (enforced by deriving customer_id
  from identity, never from a query parameter).
- Existing admin POST /api/orders and GET /api/orders/:id routes are
  untouched; this module adds separate /api/my/orders endpoints.

Validation contract
-------------------
- Every line-item SKU must exist in the product catalog.
- Every line-item quantity must be ≥ 1 and ≤ 1000 (mirrors domain.OrderItem).
- The customer_id bound to the authenticated identity must resolve to a
  Customer record (prevents orphaned orders if a customer was deleted).
- Orders must have 1–100 items (mirrors domain.Order).
