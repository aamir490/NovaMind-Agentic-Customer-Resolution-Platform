# Backend

Phase 1 retains `GET /api/health` and adds an in-memory customer/order/support-case API. Health checks only the responding process, not database, model, or AWS readiness. Interactive API documentation is available at `/docs`. See the [Phase 1 domain/API guide](../docs/phase-1-domain.md) for contracts, examples, status rules, and limitations.

See [local development](../docs/local-development.md) for installation, startup, and verification.

Phase 2 adds `operations.py` (immutable local fixtures, pure rules, and read-only service) and `operation_routes.py` (GET endpoints). It reuses Phase 1 customer/order lookup. See [business operations](../docs/phase-2-business-operations.md) for policy assumptions and the distinction between conditional eligibility and authorization.

## Future boundaries

Current modules under `app/` separate HTTP routes, domain rules/services, controlled tools/agents, and conversation persistence. `create_app()` still creates independent in-memory business stores; restart/reload discards business data and HITL checkpoints. Use one worker for this local baseline.

Phase 12 adds optional standard-library SQLite conversation storage through `ConversationService` and the agents' `memory=` parameter. Provision/open a local database explicitly; HTTP startup does not create one. Conversation text survives reopening, but missing cases/checkpoints are never restored from text. See [Phase 12 configuration, contracts, and limitations](../docs/phase-12-conversations.md).

Phase 13 adds local authentication and authorization. Configure `create_app(auth_provider=...)` with an explicit server-side credential registry; the default is empty and denies business API access. Clients send a bearer header. Tools, conversation services, and HITL callers use `authenticated(provider, token)`; models cannot supply this context. REVIEWER/ADMIN review inputs omit `reviewer_name`, which the server derives from the authenticated user UUID. See [Phase 13 roles, setup, endpoint protection, and limits](../docs/phase-13-security.md). The frontend has no login/credential UI, so its protected business calls receive 401. Health remains public. No new dependency was added.

Phase 14 adds deterministic local guardrails for agent input, selected memory, tool arguments/results, and structured model output. Existing callers need no configuration changes. Explicit injection patterns and excessive/ambiguous payloads fail safely; authentication, deterministic policy, tool restrictions, and HITL remain authoritative. No new dependencies or live services are required. See [Phase 14 limits, failure codes, and focused verification](../docs/phase-14-guardrails.md).

Phase 15 evaluates these existing components through the separate `evaluations` package without changing backend code or dependencies in that phase. **15/15 focused tests and 54/54 local scenarios passed** using scripted providers, isolated stores, and blocked network I/O. These are historical results; see [Phase 15 metrics and limits](../docs/phase-15-evaluations.md).

Phase 16 adds passive local observability around existing execution boundaries. `create_app()` owns a bounded observer and returns server-generated `X-Trace-ID` headers on handled responses. Programmatic callers bind `observing(observer)` separately from authentication; observer snapshots require REVIEWER/ADMIN. Optional local JSON logging, error/latency metrics, nullable provider token counts, and proposal/review metadata add no execution authority. **18/18 focused tests passed**, without dependencies or live services. See [setup and limits](../docs/phase-16-observability.md).

Phase 17 adds a Python 3.12 multistage Dockerfile and isolated `container/` bootstrap/health modules. The runtime is non-root, single-worker, and default-deny; optional credentials are loaded from a mounted file through existing security contracts. No business state or conversation database is seeded. Application modules and dependencies are unchanged. **14 focused container tests and Compose checks passed**; Docker image/runtime validation remains blocked by the unavailable engine. See [container configuration and limitations](../docs/phase-17-containers.md). Phase 18 has NOT started.

Keep business rules independent of FastAPI and Strands. Keep authorization outside model decisions. Review V1 components individually before reuse.

## Dependencies

`requirements.in` lists direct runtime dependencies. `requirements.txt` is a `pip freeze` snapshot of the installed bootstrap environment, not a hash-verified dependency lock. Phase 0C preserves both files and uses the installed environment without installation. Any later dependency update must be separately scoped, resolved in an isolated environment, verified, and reviewed. Do not generate a snapshot from global Python packages.
